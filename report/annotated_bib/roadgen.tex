The authors of this paper presents an algorithm for generating roads using an A* search. They claim to be able to create realistic roads using a carefully designed cost function that takes into account slopes, curvature of the road trajectory, water depth and so on. The algorithm produces a path that minimizes this cost when integrated over the trajectory. 

The terrain is first discretized into a grid of $m\times n$ grid points, where each grid point represents a height in the terrain. Then, an A* search is performed on this terrain, where the nodes in the graph is each point in the discrete grid. In order to overcome the limit-on-direction problem, more neighbors for each gridpoint than just the 8 adjecent points are considered. After the discrete path is found, the continuous road trajectory is generated by using the points as control points in a clothoid spline. Finally, the terrain is excavated and the road is created using a procedurally generated model. 

The algorithm presented in this paper is the one implemented for this project.


%The problem is first reduced to a discrete search problem by discretizing the continous domain, i.e. the terrain, into $m\times n$ grid points. Furthermore, the neighborhood of each grid point ${\mathbf p}_{i,j}$ is defined as all grid points ${\mathbf p}_{i^\prime,j^\prime}$ where $|i-i^\prime|$, $M_k(i,j)$ where $ = \{{\mathbf p}_{i^\prime,j^\prime} : |i^\prime-i| \leq k \wedge |j^\prime-j| \leq k \wedge gcd(i^\prime,j^\prime) = 1, i^\prime,j^\prime \in \mathbb{Z}\}$


%The problem that is solved is the anisotropic shortest path problem, that is, 
%
%Anisotropic shortest path: Find the path P that minimizes the line integral of the cost function, i.e. int\_P c(x,x',x''). Optimization: Use paths formed by concatenated line segments. Use a k-neighborhood connectivity mask (i.e. use more than the nearest neighbors) in the computation of the shortest path. M(p) subset of {q, where ||p-q|| <= r}.
%
%A*:
%1. When priority queue Q is not empty, select the point p with the smallest cost value.
%2. If p == final destination, we're done.
%3. For all points q in M(p), evaluate c(p,q) (that is, the cost to go to p, then to q). If c(p,q) < c(q), then we have found a shorter path to q, and we set the predecessor of q to p.
%
%In step 3: Compute M(p). Also: Compute line integral from p to q. Discretizize into n intervals then integrate.
%
%Cost function: c(p,p',p''). We have functions k\_i(p,p',p'') that evaluate different characterisitics of the terrain, and output a number. E.g. slopes and curvatures. u\_i weights this number. Then we sum over all i to find the cost.
%
%Path segment masks: Choose path segments with length <= k such that gcd(i,j) = 1.
