\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Dr. Anne C. Elster for being my primary advisor for this project. A special thanks is due for allowing us to present this project as well as the earlier work on the snow simulator at the Supercomputing 2011 conference in Seattle, which was a great experience. Her help and advice I got on this project have been very valuable. 

I would also like to thank Dr. Jo Skjermo at Vegdirektoratet for both giving me a chance to work on an exciting project like this one, as well as being my co-advisor on this project, giving me a lot of helpful tips and resources on optimizing A* searches, as well as giving valuable feedback on my report, and other very appreciated helpful tips.

Lastly, I want to thank PhD candidate Rune E. Jensen for spending quite a bit of time with me debugging the snow simulator code as well as retrieving the original source code for the snow simulator from gigabytes of an unorganized pile of old HPC lab backups.
