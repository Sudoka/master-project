\section{Visual results}
After loading the model into the snow simulator and adjusting the terrain, we can see the roads as it curves through the terrain. Figure \ref{fig:road_in_terrain_nosnow} shows the road and the terrain without snow cover. We clearly see the effects of the terrain adjustments in the bottom two screenshots, i.e. figures \ref{fig:road_in_terrain_nosnow_2} and \ref{fig:road_in_terrain_nosnow_3}. Note that snow rendering was disabled on the overview image (figure \ref{fig:road_in_terrain_nosnow_1}) in order to improve visibility of the road.

After some snow has fallen, as in figure \ref{fig:road_in_terrain_nosnow}, the terrain has been more or less covered in snow except for some shadowed areas. The snow height is continously "smoothed", so that snow that falls in areas with a steep gradient in the terrain, is moved downwards along the gradient, simulating sliding snow (think of it as a mini avalanche). We clearly see this effect on the road in figures \ref{fig:road_in_terrain_nosnow_2} and \ref{fig:road_in_terrain_nosnow_3}.
