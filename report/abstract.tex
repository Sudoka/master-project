In this report, I present an integration of a road generation algorithm, described in \cite{roadgen}, with the GPU accellerated snow simulator developed at the HPC lab at the Department of Computer and Information Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). I also present a USGS DEM to RAW heightmap converter, for using real-world maps in the snow simulator. 

Given a height map of a terrain, my road generation application generates a road that minimizes a cost function that depends on the length of the road, slope and curvature. This is accomplished using an optimized A* search, generating a discrete shortest path represented by a series of nodes. 

The road trajectory is then computed by using the nodes of the discrete shortest path ascontrol points in a clothoid spline, which gives pleasant curves in the road. The trajectory is used to generate a RoadXML file, which is a description of the road (trajectory, road profile, textures, etc.); this is then used in SCANeR Studio developed by Octal\cite{octalstudio} to generate a triangle mesh of the road. This mesh is loaded into the snow simulator for rendering. The terrain is adjusted to accommodate the road model as neccesary, by constructing a distance map for each vertex in the road mesh, then adjusting the terrain elevation according to the closest vertices.

Results show visually pleasing rendering of the roads, that looks natural in the terrain. TODO MORE RESULTS
